        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a former teacher, I developed a strong ability to communicate complex ideas effectively, foster problem-solving skills, and create structured plans to achieve goals. My teaching background has equipped me with patience, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learningâ€”skills that I am eager to bring into the field of software engineering. Through studying software engineering, I aim to acquire technical skills such as programming, software design, and problem-solving with technology. My goal is to build a solid foundation that will enable me to transition into the tech industry, leveraging my experience in education to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and solutions.</p>
